# Religious Abuse Detection Dataset

This dataset is provided for the task of detecting religious abuse in text data, especially in social media platforms. It is based on the research article titled **"Identification of Abusive Behavior Towards Religious Beliefs and Practices on Social Media Platforms"** by me (Tanvir Ahammad), Md. K. Uddin, T. Yesmin, A. Karim, S. Halder, and Md. M. Hasan.

## Dataset Overview

The **Religious Abuse Detection Dataset** contains labeled instances of abusive behavior towards religious beliefs and practices, particularly focused on content found on social media platforms. The dataset can be used for the development of machine learning models aimed at detecting and filtering abusive content.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes instances of text data labeled with categories that indicate abusive behavior towards religious beliefs. The main components of the dataset are:

- **Text Content**: The raw text that could potentially contain abusive or harmful content.
- **Label**: The classification label indicating whether the text contains abusive behavior (e.g., `Abusive` or `Non-Abusive`).
  
Each text entry represents a unique instance collected from social media platforms, and labels are provided based on the nature of the content with respect to religious beliefs.


## Usage

To use this dataset for training your machine learning models, you can download the CSV files from the repository. The dataset can be used in various text classification tasks, including but not limited to:

- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction (e.g., word embeddings)
- Model training (e.g., using algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, or neural networks)

You can use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, or `tensorflow` to load and preprocess the data.
